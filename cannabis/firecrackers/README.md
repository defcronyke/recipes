This is a quick, delicious, and effective way to make cannabis edibles, without wasting much cannabis. The original recipe which this is adapted from is terribly written and hard to follow, so here's a cleaned up version that's easier to follow.  

Makes 2-4 servings. If you haven't tried this recipe before, only eat one firecracker and then wait a couple hours to see how it affects you. I like eating two, but that can be too intense for some people. Keep away from children!  
  

Ingredients:

	2 grams of cannabis bud, finely ground  

	8 soda crackers (salted tops preferred)  

	4 teaspoons of peanut butter (the kind with just peanuts in it)  

Method:

1. Preheat oven to 320Â°F.  

2. Spread peanut butter on one side of each soda cracker. Spread it thickly and right to the edges of the crackers, using all the peanut butter.  

3. Sprinkle the cannabis evenly on 4 of the crackers, right onto the peanut butter, leaving a small border of peanut butter around the outer edges of the crackers.  

4. Put the remaining crackers peanut butter side down, on top of the cannabis crackers, forming cracker sandwiches.  

5. Put the cracker sandwiches on a plate and microwave on high for 15 seconds.  

6. Take the crackers out of the microwave, and wrap them tightly in tinfoil.  

7. Place the tinfoiled crackers on a baking sheet, and when the oven is heated, cook in the oven for 22 minutes.  

8. Remove from oven, and take the crackers out of the tinfoil. Place them back on a plate, and microwave on high for 15 seconds.  

9. Wait a few minutes for them to cool, and then enjoy your homemade firecrackers!

Let me know how it goes after trying the recipe, and I'd love to hear about any modifications you make to it and how they turned out.
